With our friends at [Vitwit](https://vitwit.com/), we’ve built Solana Validator Mission Control, an open-source toolkit to make alerting and monitoring easier for independent validator operators.

### Community

**Events**

We support events across the Solana community. Most recently, we [spoke about decentralization at Solana Breakpoint 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE_wltuj8II&list=PLilwLeBwGuK4KRFqtbBnSRRtlRXImxpIH&index=9), and sponsored the [Decentralized Infra track](https://twitter.com/ChainflowPOS/status/1621629142226665478?s=20) at the inaugural Sandstorm hackathon in 2023.

**Independent Validator Community Calls**

We help to co-organize Solana’s monthly independent validator community calls.
