The following two quotes come from The Psychology of Money, by Morgan Housel:

“Aligning money towards a life that lets you do what you want, when you want, with who you want, where you want, for as long as you want, has incredible return.”

“The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, ‘I can do whatever I want today."

To us, the concept of freedom speaks through these two quotes.

Additionally, to paraphrase many who hold true to crypto's core values of self-sovreinity, censorship resistance and decentralization: "Crypo was not created to make you wealthy but to make you free."

We truly believe this, and carry this thought through to the general potential crypto holds to create a better world.

Chainflow started as a one person operation. We remained a one person show for the first few years or our existence. Chris, our founder, was a solo validator operator when he first started supporting Solana, in the earliest days, long before Mainnet Beta launched.

Chris boostrapped Chainflow to the small team we are today, never taking any outside funding to preserve our independence.

He now feels grateful each day, even multiple times per day, that building Chainflow has allowed him to begin experiencing this independence and freedom it enables. He believes he's a better version of himself, for himself and those around him, as a result.

His primary motivation to continue growing Chainflow was to open the door for others to experience this freedom. That effort starts with the Chainflow organization.

As the team has grown a little, our intention is to manifest an organizational structure that allows those who work with Chainflow to experience this freedom.

We work to expand this further by building infrastructure that underpins an alternative to the current economy, and the power structure it enables. Our hope is that this alternative is more open, fair, equitable, and inclusive than the closed, inequitable, and exclusive power structure that has a stranglehold on today's.

## Aligned with Solana.

Through Chris' earliest experience with the Solana core team and consistent with our Solana community interactions as the network has grown rapidly through the years, we feel Solana has the deep potential and community elements required to manifest this vision. This is why we chose and continue to operate our Solana validator.

It's going to take work though. It requires a focus on manifesting core crypto values such as sovereignty, censorship resistance and decentralization in its broadest sense. Solana co-founders Anatoly and Raj reaffirmed [similar Solana values](https://solana.com/news/the-values-that-got-us-here-solana-2023) at the beginning of 2023 -

"Decentralization is the heart of web3 — and to truly embrace web3’s promise, it needs to be the uncompromising core of everything a project does. Fully open-sourced code. All activity on-chain. Self-custody. Community-owned."

Core to our ethos is continuing to advocate for true Solana decentralization. Because, if all we're doing is rebuilding today's inequitable economy and power structure on new technology, well, then what's the point?
